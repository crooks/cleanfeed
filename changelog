* Added a bad_nph_hosts parameter.  This is designed to prevent useless hashing
  of NNTP-Posting-Hosts from services that place unlinkable content in this
  header.  More details at
  http://www.mixmin.net/cleanfeed/regex.html#bad_nph_hosts.

* The binary base64 filter has been reworked, without change in functionality.

* The groups array (%gr) now includes a localhier entry which counts groups
  matching ^local\. entries.  This is currently unused by default but can be
  useful in local configurations.

* Add a sortgrps string variable containing the Newsgroups entries in
  alphanumeric order.  This is then used in PHN and PHR filters instead of
  $hdr{Newsgroups}.  It prevents distros of alt.foo,alt.bar and alt.bar,alt.foo
  from producing different hashes.

* Regexs compiled from bad_* files are now precompiled to improve performance.
  Recompilation occurs during periodic reloading of these files.
  Examples are: bad_from, bad_subject, bad_body, bad_url

* Within the scoring filter, two-point words were only scoring one in the
  Organization header.

* Posts originating at Google now score two points instead of one.  These are
  identified by the included Injection-Info header.

* bad_url and bad_url_central are now part of the scoring filter rather than
  independent filters.  Instead of instant rejects, they score five points,
  (seven required for a reject).  This (helps) prevent filtering any casual
  mention of such URL's.  For complete rejection of a URL, use bad_body instead.
