<h1>Cleanfeed - Files and their function</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
Cleanfeed consists of a primary perl script that resides in the pathfilter
directory.  After installation it shouldn't need any customisation unless
your site polices are in some way very different from normal.  Editing it
is beyond the scope of these instructions.<br><br>
Besides the main Perl script, there are a number of other files, all located
by default in cleanfeed/etc.  The majority of these are text files, one
contains Regular Expressions and one (cleanfeed.local) is Perl.  All files can
be viewed or modified with a standard text editor.

<h2>File Descriptions</h2>
The following table provides a brief overview of the various files.
<table class='one'>
<tr>
<td class='oneHed'>Filename</td>
<td class='oneHed'>File Type</td>
<td class='oneHed'>Description</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>bad_adult_paths</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Text</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Messages containing a Path string that matches an entry in
this file will be rejected if the distribution contains a group intended for
adult material. Adult groups are defined in parameters adult_groups and
not_adult_groups, but more on that in the <a href='config'>configuration
parameters</a> section.<td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='bad_body'>bad_body</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Regex</td>
<td class='oneBod'>A list of <a
href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html">Perl Regular Expressions</a> for
comparison with the message body.  Matching content will result in the message
being rejected.  This file is only intended for simple regex matching such as
spammed url's, email addresses or telephone numbers.  More complex filters
should be applied in cleanfeed.local, although a filter reload will be needed
in order to activate changes applied to that file.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='bad_url'>bad_url</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Regex</td>
<td class='oneBod'>This works exactly like <a href="#bad_body">bad_body</a> but
will only match url's.  This is achieved by prefixing all the filters in this
file with "http://" or "www.".  This file is intended to offer concenience over
using bad_body whilst also removing the risk of filtering your entire feed by
mistake.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='bad_url_central'>bad_url_central</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Regex</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Identical functionality to <a href='#bad_url'>bad_url</a>.
The "_central" suffix implies that the file can be downloaded from a central
register of spammed url's.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>bad_cancel_paths</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Text</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Cleanfeed will reject cancel messages where the Path
contains one of these plain-text strings.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>bad_from</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Regex</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Messages will be rejected if the From header matches a
Regular Expression defined in this file.  Use with caution, these aren't sanity
checked.  If you tell Cleanfeed to filter every message, it will!</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='bad_hosts'>bad_hosts</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Text</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Messages with an NNTP-Posting_Host that matches one of the
entries in this file will be rejected.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='bad_hosts_central'>bad_hosts_central</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Text</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Exactly the same as <a href='#bad_hosts'>bad_hosts</a>,
except this file is maintained and published by a central resource.  If you
don't want to use it, simply delete it and don't download the updates.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>bad_paths</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Text</td>
<td class='oneBod'>As with bad_adult_paths, except bad_paths applies to
messages posted to any groups, not just adult ones.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>cleanfeed</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Perl</td>
<td class='oneBod'>The main filtering engine<td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>cleanfeed.local</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Perl</td>
<td class='oneBod'>A configuration file for customisation of Cleanfeed's
behaviour.  Although just an example, this file provides a good starting point
and its use for beginners is strongly recommended.</td>
</tr>

<h2><a name='badguys'>The "bad" Guys</a></h2>
All of the files prefixed with bad_ are automatically reloaded by cleanfeed
after a specified number of articles have been processed by the News server.
The actual number of articles is defined in cleanfeed.local (see the <a
href='config.html#bad_rate_reload'>bad_rate_reload</a> option).  They can also
be reloaded immediately by issuing INN with a filter reload instruction.

<h2><a name='cleanfeed.local'>cleanfeed.local</a></h2>
The cleanfeed.local file is constructed in Perl and enables customisation of
the default Cleanfeed behaviour.  The sample file provided with the package
offers a good starting point to build upon.  Changes to this file only come
into effect when an INN filter reload instruction is issued.<br><br>

The following table describes the various functions within cleanfeed.local:-
<table class='one'>
<tr>
<td class='oneHed'>Function</td>
<td class='oneHed'>Description</td>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_flag_localfeed'>local_flag_localfeed</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>In many news configurations, articles are fed to the server
from sources that are considered local.  The role of this function is to identify and tag
these local articles. The operator should define one or more conditional rules that
cause the function to return True if the source of the article is local.  For example:<br>
<pre>
sub local_flag_localfeed {
    return 1 if $hdr{'X-Trace'} =~ /\.mydomain\.com/;
    return 1 if $hdr{Path} =~ /^not\-for\-mail$/;
    return 1 if $hdr{'Message-ID'} =~ /\@mydomain.com>$/;
    return 0;
};
<pre>
When True is returned, the Cleanfeed global variable $localfeed will be set
True.</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_flag_spamsource'>local_flag_spamsource</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Define a set of rules that return True if a posting
originates from a news-service that is considered a frequent source of spam.
One such example might be:<br>
<pre>
sub local_flag_spamsource {
    return 1 if $hdr{'Injection-Info'} =~ /googlegroups\.com/;
    return 1 if $hdr{Path} =~ /newsguy\.com!news\d$/;
    return 0;
};
</pre>
When True is returned, the Cleanfeed global variable $spamsource will be set
True. Besides user-defined functions, this variable is only used within
Cleanfeed's scoring functions.  Consequently if scoring is disabled, it will do
nothing.</td>
</tr>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>local_filter_first</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Instructions within this function are performed against
normal (non-control) articles.  They happen very early on in the filtering
process prior to any binary or EMP (Excessive Multi-Post) checks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>local_filter_bot</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Processed after the binary but before the EMP checks,
filters within this function are intended to enhance the in-built bot signature
scanning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>local_filter_after_emp</td>
<td class='oneBod'>As it's name suggests, instructions within this function are processed after
Cleanfeed's EMP checks.  This implies that articles rejected by this function
will still seed the EMP hashes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_filter_scoring'>local_filter_scoring</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>This function is intended to return article scores that are
appended to the score generated by the internal scoring filters.  If the
resulting score exceeds a defined threshold, the article is rejected. Scores
applied within this function <b>must</b> be correctly formatted.<br><br>
To negatively score an article:<br>
**NiceArt<br>
This will reduce the total score by 2.<br><br>
To positively score an article:<br>
!!!NastyArt<br>
This will increase the total score by 3.<br><br>
Here is an example that will deduct 1 from locally posted articles and add 2
to groups with "spam" in their name.
<pre>
sub local_filter_scoring {
    my $score = '';
    $score .= '*LocalPost' if $localfeed;
    $score .= '!!SpamGrp' if $hdr{Newsgroups} =~ /spam/;
    return $score;
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>local_filter_last</td>
<td class='oneBod'>Called last, after articles have been processed by all the
Cleanfeed internal filters.  This is probably the best function to put general
filters in.  This example will log and reject articles with PLUGH in the Subject:
<pre>
sub local_filter_last {
    if ($hdr{Subject} =~ /PLUGH/) {
        logart('plugh', 'Subject PLUGH');
	return reject('Subject contains PLUGH', 'PLUGH');
    };
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'>local_filter_cancel</td>
<td class='oneBod'>This function isn't applied to normal messages, only Control
Cancel ones.  It runs after the internal Cleanfeed Cancel checks and offers a
means to define local policies for the handling of Cancel messages.  Some
operators choose not to honour Cancels at all, as per this example:
<pre>
sub local_filter_cancel {
    # Reject all locally posted cancel messages.
    if ($localfeed) {
        logart('local.cancel', 'Local Cancel');
        return reject('Cancels forbidden');
    };
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_filter_control'>local_filter_control</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>This function is called on messages containing a newgroup or
rmgroup Control header and after internal checks have been processed.  Should
the Cleanfeed internal checks cause a message to be rejected, processing will
complete before this function is called.  In these instances, <a
href='#local_filter_reject'>local_filter_reject</a> should be used for further
actions, such as logging. All rejected Control messages have a short reason of
<b>Bad control message</b>. Example local_filter_cancel:
<pre>
sub local_filter_control {
    # Log locally posted Control messages.
    if ($localfeed) {
        logart('ctrl_rmgroup', 'rmgroup', 271)
            if $hdr{Control} =~ /^\s*rmgroup/i;
        logart('ctrl_newgroup', 'newgroup', 271)
            if $hdr{Control} =~ /^\s*newgroup/i;
    };
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_filter_reject'>local_filter_reject</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>The function doesn't quite fit the mould of the others.
Instructions within it are only processed on articles that have <b>already</b>
been rejected.  This is a good place to define log files for rejected articles.
There are some examples in the sample cleanfeed.local.<br><br>
In this example, we log <b>rejected</b> articles where the Message-ID contains
Xyzzy.
<pre>
sub local_filter_reject {
    logart('xyzzy', 'Subject Xyzzy') if $hdr{'Message-ID'} =~ /Xyzzy/;
};
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class='oneBod'><a name='local_config'>local_config</a></td>
<td class='oneBod'>Unlike all the other functions, this one doesn't contain
any filters.  It's the place for adjusting cleanfeed's internal defaults, such
as the bad_rate_reload parameter described above.  Details of all the
adjustable parameters can be found in the <a href='config'>configuration
parameters</a> section.</td>
