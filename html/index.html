<h2>Overview</h2>
Cleanfeed is Usenet filter written in Perl.  It is designed to integrate with a
variety of news applictions, although in recent times has been primarily tested
against <a href="https://www.isc.org/software/inn">INN v2</a>.  In order to use
it, INN must be compiled with Perl support:
<table>
<tr><td>./configure  --with-perl</td></tr>
</table>
Perl version 5.8 or later is also strongly recommended.

<h2>Assumptions</h2>
<ul>
<li>
It is assumed that the server operator already understands INN to a reasonable
level and has it installed and running.
</li>
<li>
A basic understanding of Perl will prove valuable in order to customise the
default Cleanfeed installation.  Customisation is inevitable as no two Usenet
servers operate with quite the same policies.
</li>
<li>
A good understanding of <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html">Perl
Regular Expressions</a> is essential before trying to customise the
installation.  Getting these wrong will result in unwanted behaviour that can
be very difficult to isolate and rectify.
</li>
<li>
Many of the examples given assume Cleanfeed files have been installed to the
default locations.  If you've chosen to put them elsewhere then you will need
to adjust the examples accordingly.
